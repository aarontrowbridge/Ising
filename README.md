# Metropolis Algorithm for 2D Ising Model

This is an implementation of the 2D Ising Model using the m
etropolis algorithm.  There are 2 versions of the metropolis 
step implemented, one being the classic version, the other being
an optimizationt to sample moves using binary trees storing
"probability masses" in a "Metropolis Binary Tree".
